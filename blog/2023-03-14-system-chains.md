Earlier today, a [Pull Request](https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps/pull/9176) was proposed to the `polkadot.{js}` wallet to add the endpoints that the Infrastructure Builders' Programme has made available to support the System Parachains (formerly known as "Common Good" Parachains).

With this event, the programme continues to progress its Milestone #2 and the relevant members of the professional route are ratified in their Stage #5.

Well done, everyone! Cheers! :beers:
