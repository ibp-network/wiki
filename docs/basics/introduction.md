# Introduction

The Infrastructure Builders' Programme (IBP) is a community iniciative to provide enhanced infrastucture services which are needed by the ecosystems of Polkadot/Kusama/Westend and other Subtrate-based projects.

## Assured decentralisation

The IBP is composed of several independent members who are micro-enterprises from around the world, the only "common" thing moving them is the shared vision to provide the top infrastructure services to the networks.

These enterprises are legally registered as companies in their applicable territories and are fully independent from each other, they operate from different geographical jurisdictions, have diverse hardware and software vendors, implement different logistic channels, and utilise different datacenters, power supply companies and internet connectivity providers around the globe.

## Assured Reliability

All the members are full owners of their hardware and have these installed in diverse colocation datacenters complying with the highest industry standards for redundancy and resilience for power, cooling and connectivity.

All services from each member are being provided from High Availability clusters and then aggregated via GeoDNS and Anycast strategies that maximises the availability of the best endpoints in each territory.

## Assured Quality

All hardware includes processors of the latest generations (i.e. with PCIe 4.0 support, minimum) leveraging on NVMe drives of Gen 4.0 with a minimum speed of no less than 250,000 IOPs per each 1TB of capacity.

All worldwide requests from the end-users are routed to the closest endpoint node according to geo-proximity, All of this in the pursue of the fastest response times at the lowest latency possible for any requesting location.

## Assured Sustainability

All datacenters are mandated to comply with 100% renewable energy targets, and for any locations where such target is still not achieved, the relevant member is offsetting the carbon credits needed for a neutral operation.

## Assured Affordability

The pricing structure for the services of the above specification are very straight forward and will most likely beat any proposal from any other centralised providers, specially those from the cloud-based giants.
