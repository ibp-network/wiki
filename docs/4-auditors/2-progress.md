### Requirements for Milestone P3

For this milestone, there is some preliminary work to be done by the members in charge of GeoDNS and Anycast services for IBP, as for example, to launch the services and register these in the `polkadot{js}` app repository:

The rest of the members of the Infrastructure Builders' Programme must report their services to the monitoring system so the endpoint administrators add their locations to the applicable geographic territories, members can only be added when they are providing services (at least 1 backend server) in each and every of these networks:

### Requirements for Milestone P5

For this milestone, there is again some preliminary work needed for the GeoDNS and Anycast services of IBP, as for example, to launch the services and register these in the polkadot.js app repository. Once these aspects are taken care of, the members can be added when they are providing services (at least 1 backend server) in each and every of these networks.
